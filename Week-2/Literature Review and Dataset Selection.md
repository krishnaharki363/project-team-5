Literature Review 
1. Cardiotocography and Machine Learning Classification

Uddin et al. (2025) investigated the use of machine learning models to classify fetal health using cardiotocography (CTG) data. Their study highlighted that traditional manual interpretation of CTG is time-consuming and subject to variation among clinicians. By applying advanced algorithms such as XGBoost to a publicly available CTG dataset, they achieved high classification accuracy (96%), suggesting that machine learning can enhance diagnostic precision in fetal health assessment. This implies that automated algorithms can support quicker and more reliable fetal evaluations compared to manual approaches.

2. Comprehensive Machine Learning Techniques for Fetal Health

Alkurdi and Abdulazeez (2024) conducted a detailed study comparing different machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree, Multi-SVM, and Neural Networks on CTG data labeled as Normal, Suspect, and Pathological. The study involved several preprocessing steps, including scaling and feature selection, and found that XGBoost performed best across multiple evaluation metrics. This research provides evidence that careful preprocessing and algorithm selection can improve fetal health classification accuracy.

3. Deep Learning Approaches to Fetal Health Classification

Airlangga (2025) explored deep learning methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for classifying fetal health using CTG data. The study showed that deep learning architectures could effectively learn patterns from complex fetal heart rate signals and potentially improve performance compared to traditional machine learning algorithms. This suggests that advanced neural networks could be valuable for real-time and automated fetal health monitoring.

📊 Dataset Selection

For your analysis, you selected the Fetal Health Classification dataset from Kaggle, which contains 2,126 records and 21 features derived from cardiotocography exams (e.g., fetal heart rate, accelerations, decelerations). The dataset is labeled into three categories: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological, as assigned by clinical experts. This makes it suitable for creating and comparing machine learning classification models to predict fetal health status effectively in your project.
