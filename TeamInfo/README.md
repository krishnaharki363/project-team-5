# Fetal Health Classification: Statistical Analysis of Cardiotocographic Risk Factors

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Perform a rigorous statistical analysis on clinical features extracted from Cardiotocograms (CTG) to identify and quantify the physiological markers of fetal distress. Rather than focusing solely on "black-box" prediction, this study emphasizes **classical statistical inference** to determine how heart rate variability, accelerations, and decelerations correlate with fetal health outcomes. 

### Planned Analyses:
* **Multinomial Logistic Regression:** To estimate the odds of a fetus being classified as "Suspect" or "Pathological" based on continuous clinical metrics.
* **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA):** To test for significant differences in mean fetal heart rate accelerations and decelerations across the three health classes (Normal, Suspect, Pathological).
* **Hypothesis Testing:** Evaluation of specific physiological benchmarks (e.g., "Do abnormal short-term variability levels significantly exceed baseline thresholds in pathological cases?").
* **Model Diagnostics:** Checking for multicollinearity (VIF), normality of residuals, and homoscedasticity to ensure the validity of statistical inferences.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing distributions and feature correlations to provide clinical context to the data.
