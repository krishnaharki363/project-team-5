Week 6: Fetal Health Classification - Statistical Modeling


In Week 6, the focus was on statistical modeling for the fetal health classification project using the Kaggle dataset. The dataset contains features such as baseline fetal heart rate, accelerations, fetal movements, and uterine contractions, with the target variable fetal_health divided into three classes: Normal, Suspect, and Pathological. The workflow began by loading and inspecting the dataset, checking its structure, basic statistics, and class distribution. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) included visualizing class distribution and analyzing feature correlations using heatmaps. For preprocessing, the data was split into training and testing sets with stratification and standardized using a StandardScaler. Two models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, were trained, and their performance was evaluated using accuracy, classification reports, and confusion matrices. Random Forest generally outperformed Logistic Regression, and feature importance analysis highlighted key predictors such as baseline_value, accelerations, fetal_movement, and uterine_contractions. Insights from the analysis revealed that misclassifications mainly occur between Suspect and Pathological classes. The study concluded that preprocessing and model selection are crucial for accurate classification, and further steps include hyperparameter tuning and exploring advanced models like XGBoost or ensemble methods to improve performance.
